# K-Means-Clustering
Description This Jupyter notebook performs customer segmentation using K-means clustering. It reads `Mall_Customers.csv`, extracts annual income and spending score features, and uses the elbow method to find the optimal number of clusters. The K-means algorithm is then applied, and the clusters are visualized with a scatter plot.
